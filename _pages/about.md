I am passionate about and experienced with data. With over 7 years of experience, I have worked with data every step of the way. I have web scraped data, extracted data using APIs, used SQL queries to gather data for projects, visualized data with Tableau, R and Python, and built machine learning models that have drastically improved results, and implemented the results to grow each organization. I am always excited about learning new things and improving. I am also passionate about sports, eating food, my YouTube channels, and geeking out about how data can improve my personal life as well. Excited to get to know you!
