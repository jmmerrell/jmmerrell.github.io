Hello! I'm Jacob Merrell, and I've had a passion for data and numbers since the fifth grade. I have generated and saved tens of millions of dollars for my organizations by building and leading innovative end-to-end ML and AI solutions. With 10 years of experience at Amazon, in FinTech, and in healthcare, Iâ€™ve expanded my skills in Python, LLMs, AWS, model deployment, SQL, NLP, GenAI, deep learning, and more. I have successfully led multinational projects, coordinated efforts across teams, time zones, countries, and continents, and trained and inspired coworkers. I also love using data to enhance my personal life. I have drive, curiosity and love to keep learning. Let's connect!
