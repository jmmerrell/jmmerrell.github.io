My love of numbers and mathematics began at an early age, and it greatly influenced my academic path. I received a bachelor's degree in actuarial science from Brigham Young University. While in school I completed a statistics internship where I helped save the organization $72 million. Something that sets me apart from most students with a bachelor's is my experience with master's level courses. Topics covered in my graduate coursework include data mining, statistical learning, optimization, linear models, and simulation studies. After graduating I worked for Milliman as a health actuaryand then a statistical research analyst at Brigham Young University. My research projects included probabilistic linkage, random forests, reliability, quadratic discriminant analysis, and logistic regression. I am currenlty a data analyst for Mercer, and use my data science skills and programming knowledge to help solve data issues. As a hobby I run two YouTube channels where I do voice impressions, and learn more about Latin culture. I use my data science skills to help me get more views.
