I am an aspiring data scientist. My love of numbers and mathematics began at an early age, and it greatly influenced my academic path. I received a bachelor's degree in actuarial science from Brigham Young University. While earning my degree I was a research assistant for the head of the statistics department, and I co-led a group of 25 students in a data linkage project. Also as a student, I completed two summer internships. The first was as a statistics intern for the LDS church. I created a tool that helped save the organization $72 million. The second summer internship was as an actuarial assistant for SelectHealth. During this internship I became acquainted with the actuarial profession, the healthcare industry, and honed my skills in SQL and R. Something that sets me apart from most bachelor's students is my experience with master's level courses. Topics covered in my graduate coursework include data mining, statistical learning, optimization, linear models, covariance structures, and simulation studies. After graduating I worked for Milliman as a health actuary. As an actuary I passed exams P, FM, and MFE. After Milliman I worked as a statistical research analyst at Brigham Young University. My research projects included probabilistic linkage, random forests, reliability, quadratic discriminant analysis, and logistic regression.
